**Who is Derek Sivers:**

One of the most original thinkers of our time, also humble and funny. In his own words: I’ve been a musician, circus performer, entrepreneur, and speaker. I’m a slow thinker, explorer, xenophile, and I love a different point of view.

**What’s on the list:**

360+ books he has read and liked enough to recommend to others.
