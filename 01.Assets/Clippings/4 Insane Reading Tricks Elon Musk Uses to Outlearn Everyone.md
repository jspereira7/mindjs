Have you ever wondered how Elon Musk appears to have extensive knowledge about everything: rockets, electric cars, brain chips, AI, etc.? It’s not magic, it’s reading.

Elon Musk is a noted bookworm, and he attributes so much of his knowledge, and his success as an entrepreneur, to reading.

But Elon doesn’t just read, he reads differently than most people do — he reads smartly and strategically, to read and absorb information more quickly and deeply.

In this article, we will uncover four crazy-good reading tricks that Elon Musk uses to learn faster than anyone else.

So if you’re ready to become an advanced reader and learn all you can, let’s talk about what makes Musk’s learning style so genius.

## 1 He Reads to Solve Problems, Not Just to Learn

One thing that differentiates Elon Musk from most readers is his purposeful reading for problem solving — he doesn’t just read to gather facts or for general entertainment.

Most readers consume a book and think, “Okay, that was cool,” and move on. Musk is the type of reader who reads with questions in mind.

He’s looking for answers, making connections, and finding practical solutions. That’s how he learned rocket science — by reading to build rockets, not to learn about them.

I’ve experienced that if I engage dilemmas just like Musk — focused on solving a tangible problem I’m experiencing — I not only remember more, but I also implement what I read.

It’s as if your brain cues in when it senses a mission. Try it the next time you pick up a book.

## 2 He Dives Deep Into the Fundamentals

While Elon Musk may be exploring something, he isn’t just learning a bit about it — he’s diving deep into the details.

He’s not learning a few items or shortcuts; he’s learning the true first-principles foundational concepts that underlie a subject.

He once said that knowing fundamentals is like knowing the foundation of a building, upon which everything else is constructed.

I notice it myself. When I take the time to learn the “why” behind something, as opposed to just the “how”, it makes a lot more sense. It may take a long time to start, but it pays off immensely.

For example, instead of learning how to write better, I learned how language manipulates people’s minds — and this fundamentally altered everything. Like Musk, diving deeper will increase your ownership of the knowledge.

## 3 He Learns Across Disciplines

Elon Musk does not stick to one field — he gathers knowledge from multiple disciplines, including physics, engineering, philosophy, and design.

This cross-disciplinary accumulation of knowledge enables him to bridge ideas that others may not easily see.

It is like having bits of the puzzle that unexpectedly connect in new ways. I have also experienced this.

As a content writer, I began reading books about psychology, story, and marketing. To my surprise, those lessons helped develop my writing in a stronger and strong relatable manner.

==Musk’s philosophy is that when you are familiar with how multiple disciplines work, you can make new things by combining them.==

Therefore, do not only engage in what you already know, but also reach beyond your comfort level.

You do not know when a lesson from an entirely different subject matter will help you gain.

## 4 He Absorbs, Then Applies Immediately

Elon Musk not just reads and moves on — he takes in what he learns and uses it right away, and that, in large part, is why he remembers it.

He converts reading into action. For instance, when he read about rocket propulsion, he used what he learned to help him build SpaceX.

I have found that I remember things much longer when I read something useful and then promptly use it in practice, whether that be a writing technique or a productivity technique.

It is as if your brain says, “Oh, this is important!” Application turns knowledge into experience.

Musk uses books as tool kits, not trophies! So next time you have learnt something new, don’t wait, use it. That is how real learning happens, through doing, not reading!

## Final Thoughts

Reading like Elon Musk is not about speed reading or bragging rights; it is about reading with intent, depth, and purpose.

What was most meaningful to me was how Musk uses books as a way to create change in the real world.

After I started to use these strategies — reading to solve a problem, going deep into the fundamentals, covering diverse topics, and using the information as soon as possible — I started to notice a significant transformation in the volume of information I was actually able to hold on to and use.

You do not need to be a genius to read like Musk; just curiosity, focus, and the will to apply what you’ve experienced.

Try even one of these tricks and start noticing the difference learning will make.
