// They've been stable in practice, but could change without notice in a
// future release:
//   - metadataCache.isUserIgnored()      — Excluded files check, see isUserIgnored()
//   - app.internalPlugins.plugins.graph  — core Graph view plugin, see ensureGraphColorGroup()
//   - leaf.view.fileItems                — File Explorer's row lookup, see getFolderRowEl()
//   - leaf.view.dataEngine               — a Graph pane's live options, see ensureGraphColorGroup()
