## Highlights
- Yes, just set that deadline.
  [Parkinson's Law states that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) Although it is counter-intuitive, you will find that through practice and experience, there is a *lot* of truth to this. Projects that don't have deadlines imposed on them, even if they are self-imposed, will take a *lot* longer than they need to, and may suffer from feature creep and scope bloat.
  By setting challenging deadlines you will actually get better results. It's all about manipulating the Iron Triangle of scope, resources, and time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfebgp61v17zcghykcea9fs))
